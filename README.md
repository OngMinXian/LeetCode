## Problems & Solutions
| Title | Solution | Time/Space Complexity | Note |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Merge Strings Alternatively | Use a for loop to iterate through n where n is shorter len and concatenate the remaining string | O(max(n, m))<br/>O(n+m) | Easy |
| Greatest Common Divisor Of Strings | Check if str1 + str2 == str2 + str1 and finding GCD of lengths | O(n+m)<br/>O(n+m) | Easy |
| Kids With The Greatest Number Of Candies | Find current highest and compare with after adding extra | O(n)<br/>O(n) | Easy |
| Can Place Flowers | Compare i and i+1 position, increment and decrement as required | O(n)<br/>O(1) | Easy |
| Reverse Vowels Of A String | Use pointers for left and right of string and swap if required | O(n)<br/>O(n) | Easy |
| Make Zeros | Use 2 pointers, 1 to keep track of most left zero and 1 to iterate through array | O(n)<br/>O(1) | Easy |
| Is Subsequence | 2 pointers, 1 for each string | O(n)<br/>O(1) | Easy |
| Maximum Average Subarray I | Siding window problem | O(n)<br/>O(1) | Easy |
| Find The Highest Altitude | Simple running sum and max problem | O(n)<br/>O(1) | Easy |
| Find Pivot Index | Use 2 running sums, left and right of index sum | O(n)<br/>O(1) | Easy |
| Find the Difference of Two Arrays | Use Python sets and difference of sets | O(n)<br/>O(n) | Easy |
| Unique Occurrances | Hashmap implementation | O(n)<br/>O(n) | Easy |
| Number of Recent Calls | Use a deque from collections | O(n)<br/>O(n) | Easy |
| Reverse Linked List | Classic reverse linked list problem, use prev curr and next variables with while loop | O(n)<br/>O(1) | Easy |
| Maximum Depth of Binary Tree | Uses DFS and returns the maximum depth reached using max operator | O(n)<br/>O(h) | Easy |
| Leaf-Similar Trees | In order traversal problem using DFS | O(n)<br/>O(h) | Easy |
